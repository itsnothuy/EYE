# DEyesTracking: A Health Informatics Eye-Tracking System

## Project Overview

**DEyesTracking** aims to develop a sophisticated eye-tracking system designed to monitor student computer use, thereby enhancing public health by reducing eye strain and fatigue. This system leverages advanced data analysis, machine learning, and software development methodologies to offer personalized recommendations for mitigating health risks associated with prolonged computer usage.

### Objectives

- To reduce eye strain and fatigue, thereby mitigating the risk of Computer Vision Syndrome (CVS).
- To improve ergonomics and productivity by promoting healthy computing habits tailored to individual needs.
- To utilize Mathematics and Computer Science, including statistics, linear algebra, and computational geometry, for the development of precise eye-tracking algorithms.
- To pioneer a preventive approach to public health in the context of digital consumption.

## Project Description

In our digital age, prolonged computer use has been linked to various health issues, including digital eye strain, headaches, poor posture, disrupted sleep patterns, and even mental health challenges. DEyesTracking addresses these concerns by using eye-tracking technology to monitor and analyze user behavior, offering actionable insights to promote healthier computing habits.

## System Development
